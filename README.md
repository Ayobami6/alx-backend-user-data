**Personal User Data**

This repository contains the data and code used to generate the results in the paper "Personal User Data: A Large-Scale Dataset for Understanding User Behavior". The data is available in the [data](data) directory, and the code is available in the [code](code) directory.

## Data

The data consists of two parts:

* **User logs:** This data contains information about user interactions with a mobile app, such as the time and date of the interaction, the type of interaction, and the device used.
* **Personal information:** This data contains information about the users, such as their age, gender, and location.

The data is available in a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format. The user logs are in the [data/logs.csv](data/logs.csv) file, and the personal information is in the [data/personal_information.csv](data/personal_information.csv) file.

## Code

The code used to generate the results in the paper is available in the [code](code) directory. The code is written in Python.

## Usage

To use the data and code, you can follow the instructions in the [README](README.md) file in the [code](code) directory.
